      <h2 className="tutorial-subtitle">Common Vulnerabilities</h2>
      <ul className="key-concepts">
        <li><strong>51% Attack:</strong> When a single entity controls more than 50% of the network's hash rate, allowing them to manipulate transactions and block creation.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:</strong> Flaws in smart contract code can lead to exploits, such as reentrancy attacks or overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Sybil Attack:</strong> An attacker creates multiple fake identities to gain a disproportionate influence on the network.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> Users are tricked into providing private keys or sensitive information through deceptive communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:</strong> Overloading the network with excessive requests to disrupt normal operations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="tutorial-subtitle">Best Practices for Blockchain Security</h2>
      <ul className="applications-list">
        <li><strong>Conduct Security Audits:</strong> Regularly audit smart contracts and blockchain systems to identify and fix vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Multisignature Wallets:</strong> Require multiple signatures for transactions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Strong Cryptography:</strong> Ensure all data is encrypted using robust cryptographic techniques to protect against unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Updated:</strong> Keep software and protocols updated to protect against known vulnerabilities and exploits.</li>
        <li><strong>Educate Users:</strong> Train users about common security threats and safe practices to mitigate risks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="tutorial-subtitle">Tools for Enhancing Blockchain Security</h2>
      <p className="tutorial-description">
        Various tools and platforms can help enhance blockchain security, including:
      </p>
      <ul className="applications-list">
        <li><strong>MythX:</strong> A security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts, providing vulnerability assessments.</li>
        <li><strong>Slither:</strong> A static analysis tool that detects vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Remix IDE:</strong> An integrated development environment that includes security plugins for smart contract development.</li>
        <li><strong>Fortify:</strong> A tool for identifying security vulnerabilities in application code, applicable to blockchain applications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="tutorial-subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
      <p className="tutorial-description">
        Blockchain security is a vital consideration for anyone involved in blockchain development or operations. By understanding common vulnerabilities and adopting best practices, developers and organizations can significantly enhance the security of their blockchain applications and networks.
